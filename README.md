# HTML-Git-CSS-Challenge

## Description
In this project I tried to understand the accessibility aspect of web development and refactor it.
I built this project in order to better understand in practice how to design web-sites, learn new technologies for me and languages of web development.
This project shows how simple it can look like a properly structured web page, how to make the code more readable and practical, and how easy it is to configure CSS styles with minimal skills and knowledge.
I learned to understand the initial code and how to change it.

## Installation
